# 🎧 Music Recommendation System

A content-based Music Recommendation System built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Spotify API**.  
It suggests similar songs based on genre, artist, mood, tags, and lyrics using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The dataset (`ex.csv`) contains song metadata: title, genre, artist, mood, tags, lyrics.
- A combined feature is created and vectorized using `TfidfVectorizer`.
- Cosine similarity measures song similarity.
- Spotify API is used to fetch album cover images in real-time.
